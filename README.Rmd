# Jonkershoek streamflow forecasting

# Introduction

Our project assessed daily streamflow in the Jonkershoek catchment in relation to daily rainfall.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='80%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/jonkershoek_old.jpg")

```

Jonkershoek is an old forestry site where many catchments are compromised by alien pine trees. Our catchment is outside of the plantations and represents a control site.

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = T, warning = FALSE}
#Change the stuff above if you want to:
# eval = F: Doesn't run the code (useful if it's just installing packages or you have saved the outputs already)
# echo = T: Show the outputs in the markdown output
# warning = F: Don't display R warnings
#...

# Read hourly metadata and display
hmdat <- read_csv("data/metadata_hourly_2025-07-09.csv")

This is the weir at which streamflow was measured.
